# Normally, Python sources should be installed to `pkgpythondir'.
# However, the Python interpreter only looks for submodules in the
# package's directory, so for platforms which use a separate
# exec_prefix, the compiled extension modules wouldn't be found.
# Instead of doing some magic with the package's load path, just do
# the easy thing and install everything to `pkgpyexecdir'.
